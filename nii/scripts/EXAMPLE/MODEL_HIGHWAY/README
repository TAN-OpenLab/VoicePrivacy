### For Highway network

Usage:
	1. prepare the network for Highway
	   
	   there are two types of layers related to Highway
	   
	   "type": "skipini":          this layer specifies the start of a highway block
	   "type": "skippara_logistic" this layer specifies the end of a highway block
                                       the hidden layers between the skipini and skippara_logistic 
				       will be covered by the highway block
				       
	   Make sure that the layer size of skipini and skippara_logistic in one block is equal
	   If the layer size is always equal, specify multiple highway blocks as:

	   block 1    skipini
	      	      hidden layer 1
	      	      ...
		      hidden layer N
	   	      skippara_logistic	
	   block 2    hidden layer 1
	      	      ...
		      hidden layer N
	   	      skippara_logistic	
   	   block 3    hidden layer 1
	      	      ...
		      hidden layer N
	   	      skippara_logistic	

	   If the layer size changes, use skipini to re-start a highway block:		      
   	   block 1    skipini
	      	      hidden layer 1
	      	      ...
		      hidden layer N
	   	      skippara_logistic	
		      
                      feed_forward (change size)
	   block 2    skipini
	   	      hidden layer 1
	      	      ...
		      hidden layer N
	   	      skippara_logistic	
   	   block 3    hidden layer 1
	      	      ...
		      hidden layer N
	   	      skippara_logistic	


	2. Change to Residual Network ?
	   just replace skippara_logistic with skippadd
