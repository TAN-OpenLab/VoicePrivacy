Note:
	This package contains the toy problems to use simple RNN,
	clock RNN, DBLSTM, clock DBLSTM

Usage:
	1. cd to the directory scripts, package the data using CONFIGPOOL/config_CLRNN.pm
	2. cd to this directory, run 00_batch.sh


Instruction:
	1. configuration for RNN in network.jsn:
	   uni-directional RNN: 	"type": "rnn"
	   bi-directional  RNN: 	"type": "brnn"

	2. by default, the non-clock schedule will be used

	3. to use clock RNN and clock LSTM (works for both uni- and bi-):
	   add "clock": "********" in network.jsn


	4. format of clock configuration:
	   A1_A2_B1_B2_C1_C3..._M1_M2
	   
	   A,B,...,M are called clock bands
	   A1: time resolution
	   A2: this band occupies the 0th to (A2-1)th dimension of the hidden feature
	   B1: time resolution
	   B2: this band occupies the A2th to (B2-1)th dimension of the hidden feature
	   
	   
	   For example, "1_10_2_20_4_30_8_40_32_50_64_70" sets 6 bands
	   1_10: the first band occupies [ 0- 9] dims, time-resolution is 1
	   2_20: the first band occupies [10-19] dims, time-resolution is 2		   	    
	   4_30: the first band occupies [20-29] dims, time-resolution is 4
	   ...

	   Note:
		1. if uni-directional rnn or lstm is used, the last number M2
		   should be equal to the layer size
		2. if bi-directional rnn or lstm is used, the last number M2
		   should be equal to the (layer size)/2
