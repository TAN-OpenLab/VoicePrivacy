### EXAMPLE for MDN ###

Directory:
	DNN: the DNN network which will initialize the MDN
	MDN: the MDN directory

Usage:
	1. prepare and train the DNN network.
           the same procedure as the DNN example.

        2. configure the MDN 
	   please use the MDN/createMDNConfig.py
	   the default there configuration is 
           [2 mixture GMM for MGC, sigmoid for UV, 2 mixture GMM for Lf0, 1 mixture for BAP]
	   without sharing the variance across dimensions
	  
           ~$ cd MDN
	   ~$ python createMDNConfig.py
	   You will see a file mdn.config, and the screen will print something like:
	   "
	   [[0, 722], [722, 723], [723, 737], [737, 888]]
	   Dimension of output of NN should be 888	
	   "
	   
	   This number is the total number of parameter for the distribution in MDN, including
           mean, variance, mixture weight, etc. 
	   
	3. prepare the MDN network
	   copy the network.jsn for DNN to MDN directory.
	   use the number shown in Step.2, (e.g., 888) as the size of the layer BEFORE MDN !

	4. prepare the config.cfg for MDN with additional options
	   
	   # path to the mdn.config file
	   mdn_config           = ./mdn.config                  

	   # path to the DNN network, which will be used to initialize the MDN
	   trainedModel         = ../DNN/trained_network.jsn    
	   
	   # a 1/0 controller, to control which layer should be initialized.
	   # the length of the 1/0 vector is equal to the number of layers.
	   # Usually, you can initialize all the layers except the input, last (MDN layer),
	   # and the output layer before the last layer (actuallt, you can not initialize it
	   # using the DNN because it has a different layer size from that in DNN).
	   # in the example, only need to initialize the 2 hidden logistic layers
	   trainedModelCtr      = 01100                         

	   # default configuration 
	   wInitPara            = 20
	   # default configuration 
	   varInitPara          = 0.001

   	   # If you specify tieVariance=0 in createMDNConfig.py, set tieVariance = 0	
	   # otherwise, 1
	   tieVariance          = 0
