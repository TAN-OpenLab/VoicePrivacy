A set of scripts for continuous wavelet transform of f0
for parametric speech synthesis purposes by Antti Suni,
antti.suni@helsinki.fi , 15.6.2015

includes:
- outlier detection and removal
- interpolation of unvoiced parts with a couple of methods
- CWT analysis and synthesis


METHOD 

The method is described in
Suni, AS, Aalto, D, Raitio, T, Alku, P, Vainio, M 2013, 
‘Wavelets for intonation modeling in HMM speech synthesis’
in 8th ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis, Proceedings, Barcelona,
August 31 – September 2, 2013, pp. 285-290.


CHANGES 

The current scripts offer some changes to the paper, 
- preprocessing is hopefully improved, but a bit experimental.
  for baseline, set interpolation to linear and omit the outlier detection
- CWT reconstruction is now correct and preserves the variance
(previously each utterance had to be normalized be zero mean, unity variance)


INSTALLATION

Requires Python 2.7 and relatively recent versions of numpy and scipy


USE

demo.py shows the process with nice plots, for example:
> python demo.py sample_files/rjs_0002.F0

cwt_parameterize.py performs the cwt-parameterization for
synthesis training purposes, writes out interpolated logF0, 
wavelet matrix and individual scales. It also contains also example
code for reconstruction.

usage: 
>python <input_f0_file>

outputs:
<input_f0_file>.interp # interpolated logF0
<input_f0_file>.cwt    # wavelet matrix
<input_f0_file>.cwt.1  # individual scales
<input_f0_file>.cwt.2
