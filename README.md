# Voiceprint privacy protection scheme based on local sensitive hash

This project proposes a new anonymization method to improve the overall performance of voiceprint privacy protection. Firstly, the privacy protection method constructs the x-vector matrix by using the x-vector of all available utterances of the speaker. Then, based on speech synthesis and x-vector matrix, the privacy protection of voiceprint in speech using local sensitive hash (LSH) is discussed. The experimental results show that the anonymization method proposed in this paper has achieved good results on all open source data sets.
