README

This script extracts 80-dim mel-spectrogram from 16kHz input waveforms
1. Run command
   $: python3 00_run.py
2. Please check the extracted *.mfbsp

If you want to change sampling rate, frame shift, or other configurations,
please check and modify SpeechProcessing.py

Note:
1. arctic_a0002.wav isfrom CMU arctic http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/
2. If you want to produce mel-spectrogram that can be used as input to the
   pre-trained NSF models in this github repository, you may need to download
   the 16k waveform from http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/, change the volume
   using P.56 to -26dev, and extract Mels-spec using 00_run.py.
   The P.56 can be found here https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.191-201901-I/en
